# fwiVis

This is package of fucntions to quickly visualize fire polygons and weather station data on [MAAP](https://ade.ops.maap-project.org/). This package is specific to the EIS fire group, and builds off of fire polygons generated by and algorithm designed by Yang Chen, weather station data interpolations by Robert Field, with file processing done by Alexey Shiklomonov and Eli Orland.  


# Installation

To use these functions on anouther MAAP account, run the following commands: 

- Within your `/my-public-bucket/` path, run `git clone https://github.com/mccabete/fwiVis.git`
- Witin a terminal, run `python -m pip install ipympl geocube folium mapclassify -q`. 
  - Make sure that the python kernel interacts with the env by running `python -m ipykernel install --user --name fwiVis --display-name "Python (fwiVis)"`, and swapping your notebook kernel to the one you just created.
- Navigate to `/my-public-bucket/fwiVis/base-fwi-vis/` and run `pip install .`
- Now run the notebook at baes-fwi-vis/fwi_vis_utils.ipynb

# Copywrite
This code is open-source and can be free used for research purposes. However, it is not generalized for use outside of EIS collaborations.
